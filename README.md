## Description✌️
Algorithm Visualizer is a frontend project with built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
In this project I have tried to visualize all the basic sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.

Star⭐ the repo if you like what you see😉.

## ✨ Requirements

* Any Browser (ie. Chrome, FireFox, Edge, Brave)
* A brain to think 🤓🤓

## Features

* Can Visualize 
  * Bubble Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Quick Sort
  * Merge Sort
* Can change Speed
* Can change the size of bars
* Can take new bars (randomly changes the bars)

## ⚙ How it works ?!
-------------------
**_Here in our model, each element value is represented by ```THE SIZE OF THE BAR``` and the algorithms sort them by placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right**

**_The algorithms moves the items around by swapping elements, Without using any addational memory with creating another array.**
